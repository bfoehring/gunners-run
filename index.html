			<h1>A Letter to Our Patrons</h1>
			<p>On September 1st Allegiant Farm will transition to Gunner's Run Stables. As with any change there is always an amount of anxiety and questions to be asked.</p>
			<p>As most of you know Ms. Jennie is moving her family to Texas. I have agreed to take over the management of the property and responsibility of the horses. So, I wanted reach out to each of you and introduce myself along with giving you an idea of who I am as a horseman.</p>
			<h2>Don Hartley</h2>
			<p>I grew up in a farming community in central Indiana. Most days were spent around cows, crops, sale barns and of course horses. By the age of 13 I was riding bareback along and through the river that led to a state park where we could sneak in the back way.</p>
			<p>Horses for me as a youngster were simply a fun way to get around before you could drive, but there was always something special just under the surface that I wasn't mature enough to realize yet. As the years passed and I was introduced to my wife and her Shire then the "feel" of the horses began to awaken.</p>
			<p>The feel has turned to passion and passion has turned into a way of life. My wife Christine and I have four horses. Summer, her shire who is now retired due to extreme arthritis is a gentle giant. Krih (Cree) is currently in Missouri finishing up some training and will be coming home with us this fall. Sage, my Foxtrotter, I rescued at the age of 2 and has been accused of manipulating me (lies, all lies). Finally, Gunner who I rescued 7 years ago and actually lived at Allegiant Farm for a time. Gunner has been a great teacher and partner for me. He and I use to run miles upon miles of trails every year. He will take you anywhere and has. He is truly a remarkable personality and was once an incredible athlete. He was retired also this year due to a bone chip and hence the name of this new venture out of respect of his years of service.</p>
			<h2>The Future</h2>
			<p>I have no plans to change boarding fees. The services you are accustomed to now will not change, and fees or lack of fee will not change for those services. I truly want to make this a seamless transition.</p>
			<p>Changes that you will see are:</p>
			<ul class="text-ul">
				<li>New lighter weight gates that will make it easier to get around.</li>
				<li>The addition of a 5 acres pasture across the street to help with pasture rotation.</li>
				<li>A riding trail around the entire property.</li>
				<li>New fencing on the East side of the mares pasture.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>My goal is to repair and replace the fencing as soon as possible. Two things I don't care for are barbed wire fencing around horses, and mud. I have already taken steps to fix the mud issues in front of the shelters. We'll keep an eye on it to see how well it worked.</p>
			<p>I have already met your horses and know just a little of each of their stories. I would enjoy the opportunity to meet with each of you so that we can discuss your likes, dislikes, and expectations for your horses and how we can help make that possible. I'll be happy to work around your schedules to make this possible. Additionally I would like to plan a pot luck get together this fall (early October).</p>
